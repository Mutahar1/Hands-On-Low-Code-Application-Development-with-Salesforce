## Overview

This repository accompanies *Hands‑On Low‑Code Application Development with Salesforce*, a practical guide published by Packt for building **declarative (low‑code)** Salesforce applications that solve real business challenges using clicks instead of code. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

It contains example code and structured exercises that map directly to each chapter of the book, helping learners become proficient with Salesforce’s configuration features data modeling, automation, security, UX design, process management, and deployment — without deep programming expertise. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## Problem

Many organizations struggle with:

- Customizing CRM applications quickly without expensive developers  
- Enforcing business logic, validation, and data quality declaratively  
- Scaling automation with clicks instead of custom code  
- Building consistent UI experiences across objects and flows  
- Managing release processes without breaking environments  

Traditional development approaches for these tasks can be slow, expensive, and hard to maintain.

##  Solution

Low‑code declarative tools in Salesforce let makers, admins, and architects:

- Define complex data models with clicks  
- Build automation with Workflow, Process Builder, and Flow  
- Secure data using profiles, permission sets, and sharing rules  
- Craft UI screens using Lightning App Builder  
- Customize community portals with Experience Builder  

This book and repo guide you through these essentials with structured chapters and hands‑on exercises that reflect real business scenarios. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

Each chapter folder contains code snippets, declarative configuration, and example metadata that illustrate how to implement low‑code patterns using Salesforce’s declarative tooling. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
